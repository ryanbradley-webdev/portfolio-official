                        With almost 10 years of experience as a Nuclear-trained Electronics Technician in the Navy, my focus has always been attention to detail and results-oriented production. As a developer I take the same approach, building websites that serve a purpose and meet every need.

                        I learned full stack development and web design through a series of professional certification courses, such as the Full Stack Engineer course with Codecademy and UX Design course with Google. Iâ€™m solidifying my skills by working towards a degree in Software Engineering through Arizona State University.
